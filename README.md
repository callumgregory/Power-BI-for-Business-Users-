# Power BI for Business Users
Thanks to a course on Udemy called "Power BI for Business Users" I have become more acquainted with presenting data in Power BI and how to tell a story based on data.

## What Iâ€™ve learnt
- How to create beautiful dashboards instead of boring spreadsheets and slides
- How to make evolving presentations based on an interactive visual story
- How to create visualizations without programming skills
- Some interesting tips to simply working with Power BI
